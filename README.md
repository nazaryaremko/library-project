In this project I practiced using event listener functions and using javascript to change DOM elements of a webpage. In particular, I learned how to create a table from a user's input which in turn is connected to the buttons on the webpage. I also practiced some basic css to make the library more presentable. To improve the page I would also change the styling of the pop-up window and make it possible to delete multiple rows at once (I struggled to do that at this time because when deleting many rows at once, their order gets messed up). Since it was a small project, I left it at this stage, but this could be easily changed with a few more hours of work.
